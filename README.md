# push_swap
sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions

## Concept of this Project ##

 The idea is simple, You have two stacks called Stack A and Stack B. 
 Stack A is given a random list of unorganized numbers. 
 You must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest. 
 There are only a few moves you’re allowed to used to manipulate the stacks that we’re going to call “Actions”. 
 The main goal of this project is to organize Stack A in as few actions as possible.
